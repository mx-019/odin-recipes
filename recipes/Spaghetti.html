        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
                <li>3 (12 ounce) jars mushroom spaghetti sauce</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce</li>
                <li>2 pounds angel hair pasta</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta</li>
                <li>3 ounces finely shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook and stir ground beef and sausage in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, breaking up chunks with a spatula, until browned and crumbly, about 7 minutes. Strain the grease and return meat to the pot.</li>
                <li>Add 3 jars spaghetti sauce to the pot and bring to a simmer. </li>
                <li>In a small bowl, mash cranberry sauce with a fork and add to meat sauce. Continue cooking for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.</li>
                <li>Combine ricotta and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Serve meat sauce over angel hair pasta and top with a dollop of ricotta mixture. Serve immediately.</li>
